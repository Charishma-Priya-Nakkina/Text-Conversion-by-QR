# 📄 Text Conversion by QR (Handwritten to Digital Text)

## 📝 Project Overview
**Text Conversion by QR** is a project that focuses on converting handwritten text into digital text using **QR codes and image processing techniques**. The main aim of this project is to reduce manual effort in digitizing handwritten content by automating the process using a camera module and OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

The system captures handwritten text through a camera, processes the image, detects the QR code, and extracts the encoded or recognized text into a machine-readable digital format.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To convert handwritten text into digital text.
- To use QR codes as an efficient medium for data representation.
- To reduce manual data entry.
- To demonstrate the application of OCR and image processing.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Tesseract OCR  
- ESP32 / Camera Module  
- QR Code Encoding & Decoding  
 
## 🧩 System Architecture
1. Handwritten text is captured using a camera.
2. The image is processed using OpenCV.
3. QR code is detected and decoded.
4. OCR extracts text from the image.
5. Output is displayed as digital text.
