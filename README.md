# 📄 Text Conversion by QR (Handwritten to Digital Text)

## 📝 Project Overview
**Text Conversion by QR** is a mini project that focuses on converting handwritten text into digital text using **QR codes and image processing techniques**. The main aim of this project is to reduce manual effort in digitizing handwritten content by automating the process using a camera module and OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

The system captures handwritten text through a camera, processes the image, detects the QR code, and extracts the encoded or recognized text into a machine-readable digital format.
